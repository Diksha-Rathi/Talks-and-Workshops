# Talks and Workshops

This repository lists the pdf version of the presentations used as a reference for various talks and workshops where I share my experiences. 

* [Speaker Session- Google Anita Borg Memoral Scholarship](https://github.com/Diksha-Rathi/Talks-and-Workshops/blob/master/Speaker%20Session.pdf) can be used as a guide by the students to apply for the Google Women TechMaker Scholarship (erstwhile Google Anita Borg Scholarship). The Speaker Session also had @SakshiJain as a panel member who shared her experience as a GHCI full student scholar to attend the two- day conference in Bangalore, India. The relevant details of the session can be found here [here](https://www.facebook.com/CodeBenders/photos/a.493225220821880.1073741829.487519691392433/1017809188363478/?type=3&theater).

* [CodeBenders Orientation- 2015](https://github.com/Diksha-Rathi/Talks-and-Workshops/blob/master/Speaker%20Session.pdf) CodeBenders is the CodeChef Campus Chapter and Programming Club of [IGDTU]() that I founded as a sophomore year student during my graduation. The society aims at promoting women in STEM by organising competitions, workshops and meet ups to foster a women only community who believe in helping each other at becoming better what they do. These slides were used as a reference for the presentation to introduce the college students to the objectives and working of the society. The society continues to maintain its social presence across various platforms: [GitHub](https://github.com/codebenders-igdtuw) [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/CodeBenders/) [Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/igdtuwCodeChef/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/codebenders)
